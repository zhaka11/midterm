                    something that runs deep within everyone, even though most people don't take the time to find
                    someone who truly respects them. It seems like people are just looking for someone to show them the
                    slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less than respect. I am convinced one of
                    the best ways to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.</p>
                <p class="text">I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect?
                    Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them
                    how highly they are valued.</p>
